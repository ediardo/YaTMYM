YaTMYM is Yet another Tiny MySQL Monitor programmed in Python 2.7
=================================================================

This tool lets you monitor all global status and variables of a MySQL Server and writes all the info to a text-plain file named status.csv and variables.csv.


This is an experiment and little documentation is provided as of now. Take a look at the wiki!
